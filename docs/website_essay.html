        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>Throughout this semester I have begun to learn how to code a website from scratch for myself. With this being my first time I had some challenges learning HTML and Wordpress. The challenges I found myself with at first was using flex boxes as i wasn't quite understanding of CSS files and how they worked.
            I would also GitHub would be a challenge for new people as I was looking at it to big not just as a tool to pull push and move around in. Another issue people would have is learning how to use HTML and what it is sensitive about such as being able to learn how to write code that works and does not have any red issues.
    As for Wordpress as a new user if you have never coded in HTML before and dont know how that works or what it is like it would be easier to learn that because you already have a set UI. But for me and others that know HTML Wordpress would be more frustrating rather than easier because its not as free and nice.
        </p>
    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>The Advantages that i would put with GitHub over Wordpress would be is that you have more freedom over all with placement on the website rather than word press there is specific templets that you can change and mess around with. I did not like the way Wordpress
        worked with the layout. The one advantage I would say Wordpress has would be that you just need to look up the website and log in to start editing rather than with HTML and GitHub you need to first get GitHub, learn how it works, consistently push and pull and hope nothing goes wrong with your files.
        But HTML just has better and more understanding ways of website creation especially with CSS files as well. As well that with HTML you can actually learn how websites work and understand the insides and workings of a websites rather than just uploading images and typing in a box.
    </p>
    <h4>Layout and Organization</h4>
    <p>The challenges for GitHub with organizing and layouts for website creation is that you need to understand placement coding and how spacings like em, px, percentages, ect. But with Wordpress you just need to find a template and or theme that you like and just type 
        in the boxes they give you and change images to be your own and place them how you want with ease. With navigation bars you have to code it in with several HTML files and set orders and placements using Flexboxes if wanted. But with  Wordpress you simply have to just add your Different pages to your nav bar through customizing and pressing menus and uploading them like in the order you want.
        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>Wordpress doesn't need many skills because it is just a UI for you to operate with so all you need to know is how to go through a website and what you want to edit and how to upload images to a website and place them like that. But with HTML/GitHub you need to know the basics of working through directories and file systems, you need to be able to pick up and learn on coding so that there are no issues with your code and
    that you know how to use GitHub and what the different commands are and how they work so that you know what does what because you cant push with a pull command and vice versa. 
        </p>
        <h4>What I Want to Improve</h4>
        <p>I would like to improve on everything from here and out especially CSS and flexboxes as I would say that they give me the most issues with coding in HTML and how to organize my layout and find out the layout that i want. I also want how to do more with Wordpress so that i can go back and forth and that i can be fluent in both ways to make a website making me smarter and more flexible. I also want to learn how to condense my code more and make it more efficient and readable.</p>
