    <h3>Look and listen of the game</h3>
    <p class="text">This Game</p>
    <h3>Setting</h3>
    <p class="text">It seems you are in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with your child, The man, and yourself the only reason we know this is because the man tells us where we are at while all we see is the table and the card game. (In the future versions of this game Inscryption we can walk around the cabin and solve puzzles.) What makes this setting distinctive is that it is all surrounded by mystery. We have an idea of what is around us through words and storytelling but other than that we are clueless.</p>
    <h3>What kind(s) of character(s)</h3>
    <p class="text"></p>
    <h3>How are you challenged</h3>
    <p class="text">The player is challenged in the way of a card game where you must think ahead and make the correct sacrifices to win the card game. With each level it gets increasingly difficult, but when you die you get to start the round over again so not to much punishment for losing but you can get stuck easily based off how you play.</p>

    <h3>Meta</h3>
    <p class="text">This game does not go meta during this iteration of the game, but it very much does that in Inscryption as that is what the game is manly centralized about in the full release. </p>
    <h3>Comments on Reality</h3>
    <p class="text">This game does not comment on reality itself. It is manlit just a game made for someone but in later insalments mainly being inscryption it does.</p>
    <h3>Speculate</h3>
    <p class="text">There is no need for speculation on a future of this game as it came out and is called Inscryption. <a href="https://www.inscryption.com/gate"><b>Click Here to go to Inscryption website.</b></a></p>
