    <h3>Look and listen of the game</h3>
    <p class="text">For the look and listen of this game It is mostly done with ambient low frequency background music.  This is under all the game noises which is very board game and card sounding as that is what the game is about mainly. You don't see anything in your distance or surroundings other than the dark and the strangers' eyes as it is meant to be mysterious and that you cannot figure out what is going on based on your surrounding but only by what the man tells you. As for the graphics i would consider it an older style around n64 or GameCube time. </p>
    <h3>Setting</h3>
    <p class="text">It seems you are in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with your child, The man, and yourself the only reason we know this is because the man tells us where we are at while all we see is the table and the card game. (In the future versions of this game Inscryption we can walk around the cabin and solve puzzles.) What makes this setting distinctive is that it is all surrounded by mystery. We have an idea of what is around us through words and storytelling but other than that we are clueless.</p>
    <h3>What kind(s) of character(s)</h3>
    <p class="text">There are two characters You as the player and the man/thing you play against. His name is leshy in the fully published Title Inscryption. You get to know the man in the way as he knows what's going on he's creepy and crazy you have a kid, but he is never seen or heard. The only reason you know is because the man tells you. The thing that makes this game interesting is because of the mystery of not only the setting but the characters as you are not meant to really know what's going on.</p>
    <h3>How are you challenged</h3>
    <p class="text">The player is challenged in the way of a card game where you must think ahead and make the correct sacrifices to win the card game. With each level it gets increasingly difficult, but when you die you get to start the round over again so not to much punishment for losing but you can get stuck easily based off how you play.</p>

    <h3>Meta</h3>
    <p class="text">This game does not go meta during this iteration of the game, but it very much does that in Inscryption as that is what the game is manly centralized about in the full release. </p>
    <h3>Comments on Reality</h3>
    <p class="text">This game does not comment on reality itself. It is manlit just a game made for someone but in later insalments mainly being inscryption it does.</p>
    <h3>Speculate</h3>
    <p class="text">There is no need for speculation on a future of this game as it came out and is called Inscryption. <a href="https://www.inscryption.com/gate"><b>Click Here to go to Inscryption website.</b></a></p>

    <p class="text">This is the Kumu network for my game and i have it sorted by 4 diffrnet catagories who the people are and what they are for the story. Next is by the cards and who the are owned by. Also I have the items in the game and who uses those items and what they do when used. And I have locations but that one is small becasue you are in 1 location the entire game.
      Some of the images i could not get as I was not able to find them in game or on the internet to use for its image
